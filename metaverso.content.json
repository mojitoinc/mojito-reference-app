Or should we just go holistically limp, submissive and follow the same pathway that everyone is sleepwalking on to their graves, slowly, unknowingly, but with a serene smile?\nSo which one is it? \nBeing human gives you the power to explore and expand your intellect in beneficial ways to oneself and others; yet we choose to waste our lives in front of a screen and lack meaningful interactions.  It seems we need to make a tough  choice: should we  choose to heal, root into Earth, and make this little sand clock we call life into a memorable one for ourselves and the whole universe or should we be a nuisance to everyone we come close to? \nThe Pill is the paradox I encounter when choosing which path to take The Red Pill or The Blue Pill.

Either way you look at it, whether you: don’t take either, or alternate between the two depends on how you feel that day.\nJust take The Red one, or throw both in your mouth like a maniac to see what happens. The Blue Pill’s ending is inevitable, when your time is running out, one tends to forget things, and unknowingly convince ourselves to take the Blue Pill just to stay  calm until passing.\nAll that you  are left with, is what  supported you the most, your bones, which will pulverize with time for the good purpose of feeding what always mattered: this planet, what is alive, what is not, and what is in transition. We don't need either pill when we can choose to use what’s left of our lives to be respectful and caring. Even when we are gone, we leave a legacy so others can carry on the gift of our values in their memories, forever.",

        "about": "Criptera was born, and is currently deeply rooted in Puerto Rico. Criptera has a Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Arts from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus. Criptera’s preferred method of work consists of intertwined mediums that include acrylics, carvings, knitting/sewing, clay-works, sketches, stop-motion, prop-creations from recycled materials & natural elements; such as plants, remains of ethically sourced specimens, concept photography & macrophotography. When it comes to Criptera’s passions there is a constant battle between biology and the inner workings of my psyche to try and showcase a holistic perception.\nCriptera creates art based on the way they feel at the moment, and sometimes they feel nothing at all, and such side effects are the total halt of their creative flow and that's why they don't tend to mass produce, although they wish that wasn't the case, because doing art makes them feel alive. Which means every piece Criptera creates  is something they felt so strongly about that they had to create it, and therefore make it an immortal memory to them and to those who relate to my work, although they keep memories sparingly, only the strong ones remain.\nIn the software aspects of things Criptera keeps it minimal because they are mostly a hands-on person, so they are slow using solely smart devices to complete a piece. Criptera uses a trustworthy sketchbook, Procreate and Adobe creative cloud to stitch ideas together.\nCriptera found out about NFTs miraculously right about when the pandemic started. During that time Criptera had to forcefully quit their job and rely solely on NFT sales to survive at that difficult time. Criptera finds it has been magical to see so many things happen as  everyone gets a chance to be a part of this community while being appreciated for their gift of creation that is being showcased to a worldwide audience.",

Growing up in an artist's household made it inevitable for her not to become a creative of some sort. Ebo acquired a passion for art at a very young age. She developed her drawing skills by replicating her favorite cartoons on paper while watching them on VHS. But observing her father work on his surrealistic paintings was her biggest influence. In 2013 Ebo began her studies in the graphic arts field at the University of Puerto Rico Carolina campus and in a couple of years, she landed her first professional job. Her skills and passion have led her to work with many renowned brands such as McDonald’s®, Kellogg’s®, Bayer®, Bud Light®, and San Patricio Plaza, to name a few.\nMost recently, Ebo has focused solely on digital artwork. Creating colorful vector compositions that hold short stories. She draws inspiration from day-to-day life, personal experiences, social issues, and misconceptions; expressing them through abstract pieces.\nNFTs have become a great pathway and an advantage for multidisciplinary artists such as Ebo. It has open opportunities to expand and connect their work with fellow creatives and art enthusiasts globally. In early 2021, Ebo began her journey in the NFT space. Some of her pieces first got collected in March of the same year. The space is fast-paced but still emerging and Ebo has no plan to stop exploring the possibilities that this world arises.",

I learned that it is not just clicking the camera’s shutter or knowing how to use it correctly, but instead like any other art, photography is the way of expressing what you see and feel to the world by capturing those precise and unique moments. Nevertheless, my interest in Photography, Fine Arts, and Design have been within me from a very young age. Inspired and instilled by the artistic side of my family which these days I am very grateful for. Since then, I started to participate in art galleries and online platforms to expose my photography to the world which I’m very proud of.\nI aspire to inspire others to fight for their dreams. I'm a firm believer that you should do what sets your soul on fire. I love sharing my passion and personal vision of the photography industry and ¨travel with no regrets¨ is my motto. I'm always striving to expand my knowledge by taking courses in a wide array of subjects that would help me develop more the way I see this world. Knowledge is the only thing that no one can take away from me.",

      "about": "Satoshi is female is a subculture movement bringing women, people of color into NFTs, so we can architect and flourish in the new digital economy.\nWe started as a small group of crypto-activists seeding the idea that the architect of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, could be anyone, could be anywhere, and could be female.\nThis is the first-ever, 1-of-1 Satoshi is Female NFT, launched in partnership with emerging Miami-based artist, Tierra Armstrong.\nFrom the artist: I wanted the subject to have a very poised demeanor in this piece as I was going through quite a large change as we all were during the time the pandemic struck. I felt an array of emotions while having the space to really process them, leading me down a path of self discovery and confidence in self something I always saw in Lydia (the muse). The rural aesthetic in this piece stems from my time spending quarantine in PR with my mother. I found it to be such a beautiful experience. I had nothing but time to go through rural lands and explore the outdoors as well as myself. I felt it was necessary to include some of the beautiful plants I would see while in the forest.",

        "about": "Tierra Armstrong (b.1997) is a Miami-based painter and muralist. Her paintings depict figures in sacred moments that transcend space and time. She uses religious iconography - colors as symbolism and light emmanations - to articulate the divinity of Black bodies. Her work often explores the balanced duality of feminine and masculine energies irrespective of gender. Influenced by her experiences in Mexico City and Chicago, she draws inspiration for her murals from the self-determinism of communities of color. She has been featured in various exhibitions including Museo del Juguete Antiguo México (Mexico City), and was commissioned to create the first Black Lives Matter mural in Miami in 2020.",

        "about": "Itzel Yard (b. 1990, Panama), also known as IX Shells, is a generative artist skilled in curatorial projects, creative concept design and experimental art. She is based in Panama, Central America. IX Shells is self taught. Her constant research is fueled by a sense of rhythm, passion and wonder. Her love for computers started from a very young age with video game missions. These quests turned into riddles and seeds of real-time visions of what surrounds us. And eventually the patterns found within the darkest alleys of our minds became a quest for parallels. IX Shells has been creating digital art collections since February 2021. One of the most significant project in her career was creating the piece Dreaming AT Dusk in favor of Tor’s Project to support journalists, whistle-blowers and human rights defenders. This auction rocketed IX Shells to the forefront of female artists working in the NFT space. IX Shells is a leading voice in the generative art movement, creating poetic visualizations of algorithms and experimental music. As co-founder of Creative Code Art, IX Shells is also a strong advocate for an entire community of artists who are pushing the boundaries of creative coding.",

      "about": "The image contains a sword and some arrows going through a Pangolin as he is holding a virus.  Pangolins are mammals of the order Pholidota. They have large, protective keratin scales, similar in material to fingernails and toenails, covering their skin, being the only known mammals with this feature. Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in traditional medicine) and heavy deforestation of their natural habitats, and they are arguably the most trafficked mammal in the world.\nAlthough there are other hypothesis about how the COVID-19 started, the nucleic acid sequence of a specific receptor-binding domain of the spike protein belonging to coronaviruses taken from pangolins was found to be a 99% match with SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus which causes COVID-19 and was thought to be responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.",
