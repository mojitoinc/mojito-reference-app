It's sunny yellow color brings confidence to whoever keeps it close and it moves your Solar Plexus... the energy point within you that can bring forth to life anything you desire.\nHow? Crystals are formed of atoms and minerals arranged in a perfect symmetric lattice which gives each one of them a specific power and allows them to influence the energy of whoever has them close.\nMy hope with this collection is that it lights up the dreams you have forgotten and that it's energy influences your space, both physical and mental, just like a traditional crystal would.\nSo stare at it, meditate with it, charge it, program it... you'll be surprised at what your intention can do. Allow it to bring abundance and joy into your life. After all, everything, including the Metaverse is made of pure energy.\nWhy not harness it in your favor? Dare to elevate your vibration and shift your life.\n*Citrino is part of a 22 piece collection of powerful crystal NFTs that will be released in January 2022.",

Rooted in an immense passion for the outdoors and wilderness, Cath mostly captures the world as little pieces of a puzzle and brings them together into iconic composite images that often leave her audience breathless as they question their own sense of perspective and reality. Her work has been featured and shared millions of times on social media and featured in publications like Sony Alpha Universe, DP Review, Art of Visuals, Open Skies Magazine and Patagon Journal.\nCath leads multi-day workshops and expeditions in places like Patagonia, The Andes, Iceland, and Canadian Rockies while sharing her work on her art with her audience. Due to the nature of her work, she only releases 10-12 artworks per year. Each image is the result of hundreds of kilometres hiked, days exploring the wilderness and hours spent creating behind the computer.\nFor Cath, art gives her a true sense of purpose and self-expression. With her work, she wishes to inspire others to break out of their own comfort zone and explore a world of endless possibilities.",

      "title": "The Pill",
      "about": "This piece was concocted merging together low-light photography & bone-crafting manipulation, animated and polished on Procreate.\nThe visual portrays how my brain surrounds the whole idea of what reality is. Is it better to keep developing the ability to calculate how every second rolls out in your lifetime,  by paying attention and accumulating data, just to make your every interaction in this world more predictable with practice? Or should we just go holistically limp, submissive and follow the same pathway that everyone is sleepwalking on to their graves, slowly, unknowingly, but with a serene smile?\nSo which one is it? \nBeing human gives you the power to explore and expand your intellect in beneficial ways to oneself and others; yet we choose to waste our lives in front of a screen and lack meaningful interactions.  It seems we need to make a tough  choice: should we  choose to heal, root into Earth, and make this little sand clock we call life into a memorable one for ourselves and the whole universe or should we be a nuisance to everyone we come close to? \nThe Pill is the paradox I encounter when choosing which path to take The Red Pill or The Blue Pill. I usually oscillate between the two. Either way you look at it, whether you: don’t take either, or alternate between the two depends on how you feel that day.\nJust take The Red one, or throw both in your mouth like a maniac to see what happens. The Blue Pill’s ending is inevitable, when your time is running out, one tends to forget things, and unknowingly convince ourselves to take the Blue Pill just to stay  calm until passing.\nAll that you  are left with, is what  supported you the most, your bones, which will pulverize with time for the good purpose of feeding what always mattered: this planet, what is alive, what is not, and what is in transition. We don't need either pill when we can choose to use what’s left of our lives to be respectful and caring. Even when we are gone, we leave a legacy so others can carry on the gift of our values in their memories, forever.",

        "about": "Criptera was born, and is currently deeply rooted in Puerto Rico. Criptera has a Bachelor of Arts in Interdisciplinary Arts from the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus. Criptera’s preferred method of work consists of intertwined mediums that include acrylics, carvings, knitting/sewing, clay-works, sketches, stop-motion, prop-creations from recycled materials & natural elements; such as plants, remains of ethically sourced specimens, concept photography & macrophotography. When it comes to Criptera’s passions there is a constant battle between biology and the inner workings of my psyche to try and showcase a holistic perception.\nCriptera creates art based on the way they feel at the moment, and sometimes they feel nothing at all, and such side effects are the total halt of their creative flow and that's why they don't tend to mass produce, although they wish that wasn't the case, because doing art makes them feel alive. Which means every piece Criptera creates  is something they felt so strongly about that they had to create it, and therefore make it an immortal memory to them and to those who relate to my work, although they keep memories sparingly, only the strong ones remain.\nIn the software aspects of things Criptera keeps it minimal because they are mostly a hands-on person, so they are slow using solely smart devices to complete a piece. Criptera uses a trustworthy sketchbook, Procreate and Adobe creative cloud to stitch ideas together.\nCriptera found out about NFTs miraculously right about when the pandemic started. During that time Criptera had to forcefully quit their job and rely solely on NFT sales to survive at that difficult time. Criptera finds it has been magical to see so many things happen as  everyone gets a chance to be a part of this community while being appreciated for their gift of creation that is being showcased to a worldwide audience."

Growing up in an artist's household made it inevitable for her not to become a creative of some sort. Ebo acquired a passion for art at a very young age. She developed her drawing skills by replicating her favorite cartoons on paper while watching them on VHS. But observing her father work on his surrealistic paintings was her biggest influence. In 2013 Ebo began her studies in the graphic arts field at the University of Puerto Rico Carolina campus and in a couple of years, she landed her first professional job. Her skills and passion have led her to work with many renowned brands such as McDonald’s®, Kellogg’s®, Bayer®, Bud Light®, and San Patricio Plaza, to name a few.\nMost recently, Ebo has focused solely on digital artwork. Creating colorful vector compositions that hold short stories. She draws inspiration from day-to-day life, personal experiences, social issues, and misconceptions; expressing them through abstract pieces.\nNFTs have become a great pathway and an advantage for multidisciplinary artists such as Ebo. It has open opportunities to expand and connect their work with fellow creatives and art enthusiasts globally. In early 2021, Ebo began her journey in the NFT space. Some of her pieces first got collected in March of the same year. The space is fast-paced but still emerging and Ebo has no plan to stop exploring the possibilities that this world arises."

An offshore hurricane left some swells for surfers to play in and for photographers to capture. This top down view offers a unique & uncommon viewpoint only possible with aerial photography. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.",
